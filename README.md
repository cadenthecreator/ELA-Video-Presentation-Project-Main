## Info

For anyone who wants to review my work the info required to navigate this setup is going to be here.

### Navigation

I want to make this as easy to use as possible. Therefore I am going to make a hierarchy of files in a setup where it makes it easy to find the info you need.

I will set up the project in a file hierarchy like the one listed below.

``` 
- repo
  |- weeks
  |  |- week 1
  |  |   |- resources
  |  |   |- script.md
  |  |- week 2
  |  |   |- resources
  |  |   |- script.md
  |  |- week 3
  |  |   |- resources
  |  |   |- script.md
  |  |- week 4
  |  |   |- resources
  |  |   |- script.md
.
.
.
```

You can find all the resources such as code images documents and websites i used in the making of the video. You can find the script for the video in the `script.md` file incase you want to read it or you are deaf.

There might be more weeks here than videos that is because I might miss a few weeks or not much happened.
If you have any questions I have contacts that will be listed at the bottom of this document also be nice and don't spam me.

> [!NOTE]
> If there is any missing info I will add it.
