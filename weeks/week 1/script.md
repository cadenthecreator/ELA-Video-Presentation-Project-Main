# Introduction
Hello, my name is Caden, the reason why I am making these, is because I want to get through ELA. For ELA I will create I series of video essays/journals, ~1 per week is my goal, however I will set a baseline of 2 per month.
My goal for this is to get me through ELA so I don't have to read books all day.

# What have I learned this week
This week I i started on a course about the introduction to the applications of algebra in machine learning.
Therefore this will be what this video is about.

### Details
The course was an introduction to algebra in machine learning but mainly focused on linear algebra.
I first learned about the basic concepts of linear algebra but moved on to 2*2 matricies then 3*3 matricies.
