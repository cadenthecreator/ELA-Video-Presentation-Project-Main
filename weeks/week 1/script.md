# Introduction
Hello, my name is Caden, the reason why I am making these, is because I want to get 
through ELA. For ELA I will create a series of video essays/journals; ~1 per week is 
my goal. However, I set a baseline of 2 per month.

# What have I learned this week
This week I started on a course about the introduction to the applications of algebra in machine learning.
Therefore this will be what this video is about. The course started with systems of sentences.

### What is linear algebra?
Linear algebra is algebra except you use matrices to describe systems of equations.

### What are systems of sentences?
Systems of sentences is a metaphorical representation of the underlying concepts of systems of equations in linear algebra. In simple terms, it's making a few statements, and that's 
it. For example, the cat is orange, the dog is brown, and the bird is blue. Thinking about this logically, the information you get is that the cat is orange, the dog is brown, and the 
bird is blue. However, that's a very basic representation. Another one would be the cat is orange, the dog or the cat is brown, the dog or the cat or the bird is blue. That still gives 
you the same information, but you have to work for it. And that's the idea behind why this is a useful representation.

### Types of systems
In linear algebra, there are different types of systems. There are three main ones. There is a complete system, a redundant system, and a conflicting system. A complete system 
gives you the same amount of information as there are lines. For example, the system, the dog is brown, the cat is orange, and the bird is blue, is a complete system. Because you get 
three pieces of information with three lines. The system, the dog is brown, the cat is orange, and the dog is brown. It is a redundant system because you only get two pieces of 
information for three lines. The system, the dog is brown, the dog is orange, is conflicting. Because the dog cannot be brown and orange at the same time.

### Singularity
There is also the concept of singularity. A system can be either singular or non-singular. These singular or non-singular systems can have solutions or not have solutions. If it's 
singular, it is non-solvable and if it's non-singular, it is solvable. That's a basic rundown.

### 2X2 Systems
Moving on to math. In linear algebra, we usually use math instead of sentences. For example, A plus B is equal to 5. It's an equation, however, it has infinitely many solutions, 
meaning that there is no definite solution we can come across, meaning it is unsolvable. And these unsolvable equations can be remedied using systems. So if we take a system where we 
have the variables A and B for apples and bananas, and let's say we're in a store that when we buy something doesn't tell us the individual price of each item, they just tell us the 
combined price. And our goal is to figure out the individual prices. Let's say we go for two days. On the first day, we buy one apple and one banana. It costs us $10. On the next day, 
we buy one apple and two bananas. It costs us $14. We can conclude that the banana is equal to $4 and the apple is equal to $6 because 4 plus 6 is equal to 10. And the second day, we 
got one more banana. Therefore, we had an increase of $4 in the price, hence the $4 increase. That's how we would solve one of these. All the previous concepts apply here. Since we 
have two lines and we're getting two pieces of information, A is equal to 6 and B is equal to 4, this is a complete system. And it is singular because we can solve it.

### The Determinant
The determinant is a property of matrices that you can use to determine if it is singular or non-singular. A singular matrix would have a determinant of zero and a non-singular matrix 
would have a determinant of not zero. And how you calculate the determinant is the diagonal minus the anti-diagonal. For example, AD minus BC. That is the diagonal minus the anti-
diagonal. So if you have 1,1,1,1, it would be  1 times 1 minus 1 times 1 or 1 minus 1, which would equal zero. But if you had 112, it would be 1 times 2 minus 1 times 1, which to take 
away 1 is negative 1, which would mean that it is non-singular. So it is solvable. And that is a basic rundown of the determinant.

# Conclusion
I decided this was a good stopping point because I didn't think I needed to go further than this and I think it gave a decent amount of info.
