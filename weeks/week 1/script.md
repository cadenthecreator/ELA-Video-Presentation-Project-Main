# Introduction
Hello, my name is Caden, the reason why I am making these, is because I want to get through ELA. For ELA I will create a series of video essays/journals; ~1 per week is my goal. However, I set a baseline of 2 per month.
My goal for this is to get me through ELA so I don't have to read books all day.

# What have I learned this week
This week I started on a course about the introduction to the applications of algebra in machine learning.
Therefore this will be what this video is about. The course started with systems of sentences.

### What is linear algebra?
Linear algebra is algebra except you use matrices to describe systems of equations.

### What are systems of sentences?
Systems of sentences is a metaphorical representation for the underlying concepts of systems of equations in linear algebra. In simple terms, it's making a few statements, and that's it. For example, the cat is orange, the dog is brown, and the bird is blue. Thinking about this logically, the information you get is that the cat is orange, the dog is brown, and the bird is blue. However, that's a very basic representation. Another one would be the cat is orange, the dog or the cat is brown, the dog or the cat or the bird is blue. That still gives you the same information, but you have to work for it. And that's basically the idea behind why this is a useful representation.
